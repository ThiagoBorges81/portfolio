									<h3>Post Doctoral Researcher</h3>
									<h3>University of São Paulo - Brazil - 2021 - 2023</h3>
									<p>I have developed sports data research where I investigated the competitive demands of the best rowers in the World for the last decade. The results of my research showed that world-class rowers present similar racing management regardless of their age group, suggesting coaches implement race management strategies development from a young age. Also, Rowers peak performance at a similar age for individual- and double-crew boats, whereas boats with four rowers present a younger age.</p>
									<p>Additionally, other tasks included assisting graduate students with their research providing scientific methods and data handling (data handling, data analysis) advice. </p>
									<p>I completed the contract on time, delivered my final report, and submitted my research for publication.</p>

										<h2> Learn-to-Rank Classification</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/ThiagoBorges81/cross_selling_learn_to_rank" class="image fit"><img src="images/ltr_classf.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Cross-selling is a powerful strategy for companies wanting to unlock higher revenue, build a stronger relationship with current clients, and provide excellent additional services or products to help clients solve their problems. The (fictional) company "Are you insured?" provides health insurance services to thousands of clients. The company expanded its service portfolio and inquired its current clients whether they would be interested in acquiring their new product - car insurance service.</p>
									<p>After 304 thousand clients replying to the inquiry, the company still has to offer the car insurance service to approximately 75 thousand clients that have not answered the research. Due to budget limitations, the company can contact only 20 thousand clients, out of those 75 thousand. Therefore, an optimized, ranked list would be required to increase the chances of contacting clients with actual interest in buying this new product. Therefore, an objective solution must be developed to optimize the operation.</p>
                                    <p>The final product of this project is a Google Sheets document that is linked to the machine learning model currently in production. This document provides a list of customers who are likely to purchase car insurance, based on the predictions made by the model.</p>

									<li>Microsoft VSCode.</li>
									<li>Render Cloud.</li>
									<li>Flask, and Python API.</li>

										<h2>Time-Series - Forecasting</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/ThiagoBorges81/ds_to_production" class="image fit"><img src="images/timeseries_forecasting.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>"End-to-end" Data Science project, where I applied several techniques including CRISP-DS, machine learning models for data processing and sales forecasting of a (fictional) pharmacy chain.</p>
									<p>After receiving a business problem from the company's CFO, the requested task was to forecast sales revenue for six weeks, based on a supervised machine learning procedure. After detailed data processing and sending the model to production, a bot was created in Telegram, where the CFO would be able to access the forecasts of each store, through his cell phone.</p>
									<p>This project delivers Machine Learning forecasting for sales product with the benefits of using a chatbot to deliver the results conveniently.</p>
									<h3>Tools used in this project:</h3>
									<li>Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, requests, inflection, xgboost, scipy, boruta, matplotlib.</li>
									<li>Sklearn.</li>

										<h2>Rowing Race Data ETL</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/ThiagoBorges81/etl_rowing_world_champs" class="image fit"><img src="images/rowing.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Rowing boasts a rich Olympic tradition and is a widely-practiced sport in numerous universities globally. It has also become a popular lifestyle exercise. The sport features three major world-level competitions categorized by age groups: Under 19, Under 23, and Senior. These competitions yield valuable data crucial for understanding the nuances of rowing. Unfortunately, even though this data is public, it is presented in PDF files, posing challenges for organization and analysis.</p>
									<p>I created a process to gather competition data from world-class Rowers. Data was stored in more than 250 PDF files. It was necessary to download the files from a public source, where the PDFs were stored, create codes using Python and specific libraries to extract all the content of each PDF file. Once the data was extracted in <i>string</i> format, I carried out all the formatting and processing to use the data in academic research.</p>
									<h3>Tools used in this project:</h3>

										<h2>Optimizing real estate purchases and sales</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/ThiagoBorges81/house_rocket" class="image fit"><img src="images/real_estate.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project looks into how to maximize profits in a Real Estate business. I used Python and its libraries for data analysis and statistics to detect properties with profit potential. Thus, properties could be bought by the company and sold with interesting profit margins. Purchase insights were based on property characteristics that include location, property size, and number of rooms, among others.</p>
									<p>I built a web application using Streamlit and Streamlit Share to facilitate and optimize decision-making by the company's stakeholders. The result of the presented solution, if implemented, would be an average profit of $71700.00.</p>
									<h3>Tools used in this project:</h3>
									<li>Python, Pandas, Numpy and Seaborn.</li>
									<li>Jupyter Notebook.</li>
									<li>Plotly and Folium interactive maps.</li>

									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/ThiagoBorges81/google_da_certificate_capstone" class="image fit"><img src="images/bike_nyc.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project provides insights into the following problem: How do clients use the service? What are the demands of the service?</p>
									<p>As the company is planning future actions, the marketing team need to understand how clients use the service and what can be done to maximize profit.</p>
